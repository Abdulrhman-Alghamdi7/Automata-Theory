# Regular-Languages

This project is a study of regular languages and automata, following Sipserâ€™s Introduction to the Theory of Computation. It provides code implementations of fundamental definitions, theorems, and lemmas from the theory, including:
- Finite automata constructions and operations
- Regular expression to automaton conversion
- NFA to DFA determinization
- Union, concatenation, and Kleene star
The aim is not to build a library, but to practice and illustrate the formal results of automata theory through direct implementation.
